**`rizzo-pii:0.3B`** is a lightweight, CPU-friendly, **Italian-first** token-classification
model (≈0.3B parameters, [mmBERT](https://huggingface.co/jhu-clsp/mmBERT-base) / ModernBERT
backbone) that detects **22 categories of personal data** — including the Italian-legal
identifiers (**codice fiscale**, **partita IVA**, **dati catastali**) that no other open model
covers — and drives a fully **reversible** anonymization workflow:

<div align="center">

🔒 **anonymize locally** → 🏷️ **placeholder + reversible local dictionary** → ☁️ **frontier LLM** → 🔓 **restore locally**

</div>

It is built for law firms, accountants, notaries and anyone bound by the **GDPR** who wants to
keep using ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini on sensitive documents **without ever sending the real data
out**.

## The problem: convenience is leaking your data

People summarize contracts, draft replies and ask legal questions simply by **pasting the
document in**. It is fast and useful — and it quietly moves enormous amounts of personal and
confidential data off the user's device. Names, addresses, tax codes, IBANs, health details,
unsigned-contract clauses: all of it crosses the network to servers the user does not control,
where it may be logged, cached, retained or exposed in a breach. For a law firm or a hospital this
is not hypothetical; under the GDPR it can be a direct compliance failure.

The intuitive fix is to **stop sending data out** and run an open model locally — but a
frontier-grade open model is large and expensive to serve (€9,000–€10,000 of hardware), and the
small models that fit a normal laptop are **not** in the same league on the hard tasks (legal
reasoning, dense contracts, long official documents) — exactly where Italian professionals need
the most help.

**The trade-off we actually want:** keep the frontier model and *remove the data from the
equation*. Anonymize the document **locally** on a CPU, send only placeholders to the cloud, and
restore the real values **locally** from the answer. The sensitive content never leaves the
machine.

---

## rizzo-pii in one picture

The workflow has three local steps and one remote step. Locally, rizzo-pii tags every span of
personal data and replaces each one with a stable, type-aware placeholder
(`[FULLNAME_1]`, `[IBAN_1]`, `[CF_1]`), recording the mapping `placeholder → real value` in a
dictionary that **stays on disk**. Identical values share the same placeholder, so the frontier
model still sees a coherent text and can reason about it. The anonymized text is sent to
ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini; when the answer comes back, a local pass swaps the placeholders for the
true values. **The cloud provider never receives a single real name, code or number.**

<div align="center">
<img src="report/images/schema_explainable.png" alt="The rizzo-pii workflow: everything runs locally on CPU; only placeholder text crosses to the cloud, and the answer is re-identified locally" width="780" />
</div>

Everything except the frontier query happens on the user's CPU; only placeholder text crosses the
boundary, and the answer is re-identified locally.

---

## Why this is different: privacy that is actually private

This is not "yet another PII detector". It is an **architecture for using powerful models without
surrendering data**, built so the privacy guarantee is structural rather than a promise:

- **The data never leaves the device.** Detection and re-identification run locally on a CPU.
  No API key, no telemetry, no upload. What the cloud receives is already stripped of identifiers.
- **GDPR by design.** The workflow implements **data minimization** (Art. 5) almost literally:
  the third-party processor only ever sees pseudonymized text, so the most common reason a cloud
  LLM call is unlawful (transferring identifiable data to a third party without a basis) is removed
  at the source.
- **Aligned with the EU AI Act.** Keeping personal data under local control and out of
  third-party model pipelines supports the Act's emphasis on data governance.
- **Accessible to everyone.** The model is ≈0.3B parameters and runs on a CPU in well under 1 GB
  of RAM — the privacy layer costs nothing extra in hardware. A normal laptop is enough.
- **Reversible, not destructive.** Classic redaction throws information away. rizzo-pii
  **pseudonymizes**: the answer from the frontier model is reconstructed with the real values, so
  the tool is useful in real work, not just compliance theater.

### How it compares

| Property | **rizzo-pii:0.3B** | OpenAI Privacy Filter | MS Presidio |
|---|---|---|---|
| Type | Dense encoder (mmBERT / ModernBERT) | Sparse MoE encoder | NER + rules pipeline |
| Parameters | ≈0.3B dense (all active) | 1.5B total / ≈50M active | spaCy model + rules |
| Memory to load | 0.5–1.2 GB | 1.5B params resident | Varies (spaCy) |
| Runs on | CPU, under 1 GB RAM | On-device | CPU |
| Categories | **22 (incl. IT-legal)** | 8 generic | Configurable; EN defaults |
| Italian CF / PIVA / catasto | **Yes** | No | Not by default |
| Primary language | Italian (+7 more) | English | English |
| Checksum validation | **Yes** (IBAN/CF/PIVA/card) | No | Some recognizers |
| Reversible mapping | **Yes** (local dict) | Masking | Anonymization |

The differentiators are **Italian-legal coverage**, a **smaller memory footprint**, and a
**checksum-backed safety net** (mod-97 for IBAN, Luhn for cards, the official CF/PIVA algorithms)
that the larger generic models do not provide.

> **Concrete example.** Take *"Il Sig. Mario Rossi, C.F. RSSMRA85H12F205Z, P.IVA 12345678901, è
> titolare dell'immobile al Foglio 12, particella 345, sub. 6."* rizzo-pii tags `FULLNAME`, `CF`,
> `PIVA` and `CATASTO` and rewrites it as *"Il Sig. [FULLNAME_1], C.F. [CF_1], P.IVA [PIVA_1], è
> titolare dell'immobile al [CATASTO_1]."* A generic English-first model has no label for the
> fiscal code, the VAT number or the cadastral reference — the three most sensitive identifiers in
> the sentence — and would leave them in the clear.

---

## The taxonomy: 22 tags, and why

rizzo-pii predicts 22 entity types in **BIO** format (a `B-`/`I-` label per tag, plus `O`). The
raw datasets are left untouched; the mapping to these 22 tags is applied **at load time** through a
single `TAG_MAP` in `train_pii.py`, so the taxonomy can be changed in one place without
re-annotating anything. Details in **[docs/TASSONOMIA_TAG.md](docs/TASSONOMIA_TAG.md)**.

| Tag | Meaning | Example | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FULLNAME` | Person name (incl. legal roles: judge, lawyer, parties, witness) | Mario Rossi | real+synth |
| `AGE` | Age | 45 anni | real |
| `GENDER` | Sex / gender | Femmina | real |
| `DATE` | Calendar date | 12/06/1985 | real+synth |
| `TIME` | Time of day | ore 15:30 | real |
| `STREET` | Street / square | Via Garibaldi | real+synth |
| `BUILDINGNUM` | Street number | 24 | real+synth |
| `ZIPCODE` | Postal code (CAP) | 00185 | real+synth |
| `CITY` | City | Milano | real+synth |
| `PROVINCE` | Province abbreviation | MI | synth |
| `EMAIL` | E-mail (incl. PEC) | m.rossi@studio.it | real+synth |
| `TELEPHONENUM` | Phone number | +39 333 1234567 | real+synth |
| `CF` | Codice fiscale (personal tax code) | RSSMRA85H12F205Z | synth |
| `PIVA` | Partita IVA (VAT number) | 12345678901 | real+synth |
| `ID_DOC` | ID / passport / licence / social number | CA12345AB | real+synth |
| `IBAN` | IBAN / bank account | IT60X05428… | synth |
| `CREDITCARDNUMBER` | Credit-card number | 4111 1111 1111 1111 | real |
| `AMOUNT` | Money amount | € 12.500,00 | synth |
| `TARGA` | Vehicle plate | AB 123 CD | synth |
| `ORG` | Private company / firm / bank | Edilnord S.r.l. | synth |
| `DOCID` | Act identifier (RG, protocol, repertory, ruling) | 1234/2024 | synth |
| `CATASTO` | Cadastral data (sheet, parcel, sub.) | Foglio 12, part. 345 | synth |

**Two design decisions stand out.** First, **legal roles collapse into `FULLNAME`** — whether
"Mario Rossi" is the judge, the lawyer or a witness is not a property of the string; the role, if
needed, is recovered downstream as metadata. Second, **raw types that mean the same thing are
merged**: names + surnames → `FULLNAME`; `PEC` → `EMAIL`; `TAXNUM` → `PIVA`; ID card / passport /
licence / social number → `ID_DOC`; account number → `IBAN`. Honorifics (`Dott.`, `Avv.`) and the
name of the **court** itself are dropped to `O` because they are not identifiers to mask.

The five Italian-legal tags (`CF`, `PIVA`, `CATASTO`, `DOCID`, `PROVINCE`) are the reason
rizzo-pii exists: they do not appear as labeled data in any public corpus, so they are created
through synthesis with mathematically valid checksums.

### Security documents: the optional `cyber` detector pack

Security work — assessment reports, forensic timelines, incident tickets, log extracts — has the
same need, plus an NDA on top of the GDPR. Its identifiers are not in the 22 tags, though: IP
addresses and CIDR ranges, domains, URLs, MACs, hashes, wallets, cloud identifiers, paths that
embed a username, domain accounts, ASNs. They are all **structured**, so they are covered by an
**opt-in pack of deterministic detectors** — regex plus validators, no retraining, no new
dependency (`ipaddress` from the stdlib for IP/CIDR, Base58Check via `hashlib` for Bitcoin):

```bash
python src/app/app.py --detectors cyber      # or: PII_DETECTORS=cyber
```

It also recognizes **defanged** indicators (`203[.]0[.]113[.]42`, `evil(.)com`, `hxxps://`) — the
form these values usually take in a report — and ships a **keeplist** so that public references
(`CVE-…`, `CWE-…`, ATT&CK techniques, `RFC …`) are never masked: replacing `CVE-2024-3094` with a
placeholder would make the sentence unreadable for the frontier model while protecting nobody.

With the pack disabled — the default — behaviour on legal documents is unchanged: a court docket
number must never turn into an IP address.

### Choosing what to mask: profiles and policy

Masking every category is the right default, but not always the right answer. A task that asks the
frontier model to cross-check two amounts cannot work on `[AMOUNT_1]` vs `[AMOUNT_2]`; in a clinical
setting, age and sex are often the object of the study rather than the identifier to remove. A
**policy** decides, per tag, whether an entity is masked (reversible placeholder — the default) or
left in clear, resolved through the same chain used for host/port:
**CLI > env > `policy.json` > default**.

```bash
python src/app/app.py --profile clinical               # AGE, GENDER, DATE, TIME stay readable
python src/app/app.py --keep-tags AMOUNT               # amounts stay comparable
PII_KEEP_TAGS=AGE,GENDER python src/app/app.py         # same, from the environment
python src/training/test_pii.py --profile clinical "…"
```

Entities left in clear are still **detected and reported** (`action: "keep"`,
`preservation_reason: "excluded_by_config"`, counted in `n_kept`); they simply never enter the
reversible dictionary, because there is nothing to restore. Profile and tags are also editable from
the ⚙️ dialog in the app and apply immediately, with no restart. Keeping a direct identifier
(`FULLNAME`, `CF`, `IBAN`…) in clear is allowed, and warned about.

The two compose: with the `cyber` pack enabled its labels join the taxonomy the policy validates
against, so `--detectors cyber --keep-tags URL` is a valid combination.

### Whose value is it: scope

In a security report the same tag needs opposite treatment depending on **who owns the value**.
The client's IP address must be masked; the attacker's C2 address is the subject of the document —
masking it makes the report unreadable and protects nobody. `--keep-tags IP` cannot express that:
`IP` is a single tag.

A **scope** file assigns a role to a value — `own`, `adversary`, `public` — and the policy decides
per *(tag, role)* instead of per tag alone:

```bash
python src/app/app.py --detectors cyber --profile security-report \
                      --scope-file ~/engagements/acme/scope.json     # or PII_SCOPE_FILE
```

```json
{
  "own":       {"IP": ["10.0.0.0/8", "203.0.113.5"], "DOMAIN": ["client.example"]},
  "adversary": {"IP": ["198.51.100.7"], "DOMAIN": ["evil.example"]},
  "context":   {"roles": ["adversary"], "window": 60}
}
```

IP entries match by network membership (a `/8` covers every address inside it), domain entries
match by label so `mail.client.example` is covered while `evilclient.example` is not, and a URL
inherits the role of its host — list `evil.example` once, not every URL under it. Defanged forms
(`198[.]51[.]100[.]7`, `hxxps://`) match their plain entries.

Everything the lists do not cover is `unknown`, and `unknown` is masked. **The textual-context
heuristic is opt-in**: without `context.roles` it stays off entirely. That asymmetry is deliberate
— a wrong `own` guessed from surrounding words means extra masking, a wrong `adversary` means
sensitive data left in clear, so a heuristic is not allowed to unlock "keep" on its own. Even when
enabled, cues belonging to two different roles inside the same window cancel the decision instead
of outvoting each other.

The `security-report` profile ships the usual answer: adversary and public indicators
(IP, DOMAIN, URL, HASH, WALLET, ASN, MAC, CLOUDID) stay readable, everything else is masked.
`PATH` and `USER` are deliberately excluded — a path often embeds the username of a compromised
machine, which belongs to the client.

The scope file lists the client's addresses and the adversary's indicators, so it is **the most
sensitive file in the system**: it has no default location, belongs to the engagement rather than
to the installation, and must live outside the repository — one per engagement. `GET /scope`
reports how many entries exist per role and tag, never which; there is deliberately no `POST`.
A configured but unreadable scope file stops startup instead of silently degrading to no scope.

## Dataset & training

The model is fine-tuned on a **multilingual** pool of ≈**745k** labeled rows (Italian reinforced to
~45%) assembled from four sources — real (Ai4Privacy, DeepMount) and synthetic — all remapped to the
22 tags at load time. The synthetic part follows the **"LLM author, code labeler"** principle: an
LLM writes only Italian legal prose with placeholders (`{SLOT}`) and our code injects the real
values (CF/PIVA/IBAN with valid checksums), so BIO labels are exact, identifiers are valid by
construction, and **no real personal data is ever produced by the LLM**. The backbone is
**mmBERT-base** (ModernBERT architecture, native 8192-token context) and training runs in a single
epoch on one 16 GB consumer GPU.

> 📄 **The full dataset composition, the synthesis method, the training recipe and the
> experiments are described in the [technical report](report/rizzo-pii-report.pdf).** See also
> [docs/DATASET.md](docs/DATASET.md) and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the operational details.

## Results

Training was a single epoch (~26.6k steps over 744,912 rows). The loss fell from ≈6.2 to below 0.1
within the first few hundred steps, then settled into a clean, monotone, low regime; the validation
loss decreased monotonically and was **still falling** when the epoch ended. Final training loss
≈**0.003** and validation loss ≈**0.006** are both very low and very close, so the model is **not
over-fitting** — a second epoch would very likely push it lower still.

Italian-legal identifiers scores a perfect 1.000**.

### Per-tag precision / recall / F1 (v1.2.0)

| PIVA | 514 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | | TARGA | 43 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |

All five Italian-legal identifiers (`CF`, `PIVA`, `CATASTO`, `DOCID`, `PROVINCE`) score a perfect
1.000, as do `ID_DOC`, `DATE`, `TELEPHONENUM`, `GENDER` and `TARGA`. The remaining soft spots are
the open, high-variability classes (`ZIPCODE`, `CREDITCARDNUMBER`, `STREET`, `CITY`) and `ORG`,
which is exactly where a larger, better-balanced dataset would help.

---

## Deployment: it runs on a normal computer

The released checkpoint is ~1.2 GB on disk in fp32 and runs comfortably on a **CPU**: quantized, its
memory footprint is on the order of **0.5 GB**, with **no GPU required**. That is the whole point —
the privacy layer is cheap enough to run on the laptop the user already owns.

In production the neural model is **never used alone**. It is paired with a deterministic **regex +
checksum** network for the structured identifiers (EMAIL, phone, IBAN, CF, PIVA, credit card,
amount, plate), where IBAN/PIVA/card must pass their **checksum** (mod-97 / Luhn) to be accepted,
and a valid checksum **overrides** the model. This eliminates the classic failure mode of a neural
tagger fragmenting a long code, and gives mathematically certain detection for exactly the
identifiers whose leakage is most damaging. The app adds the reversible layer (stable placeholders,
downloadable local dictionary, a "restore" tab tolerant to markdown/format drift), chunking with
overlap for long PDFs, and a colored per-tag UI.

| To use the model (inference) | To retrain the model |
|---|---|
| Any 64-bit CPU (no GPU) | A single 16 GB GPU is enough |
| 0.5–1.2 GB RAM for the model | Reference run: RTX 5060 Ti, ~2 h |
| Windows (installer) / Linux / macOS | PyTorch `cu128` for Blackwell |
| Fully offline; no API key | ~745k rows, regenerable from scripts |

The desktop app **Rizzo PII** (Tauri) launches the Python/Flask backend as a bundled CPU
"sidecar"; a CPU-only PyTorch build keeps it fully **offline** on Windows (WebView2), macOS and Linux.

## Quickstart

> Prerequisites and critical environment constraints (Blackwell GPU, torch **cu128**, etc.) are in
> **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)**. The `dataset/raw/` sources are downloaded from Hugging Face (see the
> `hf download` commands in CLAUDE.md). All scripts force UTF-8 and resolve their paths from
> `__file__`, so they run from any working directory.

> 💡 Just want to **use** the app? You don't need any of this — download the ready-to-use build
> (Windows / macOS / Linux) from the
> [Releases page](https://github.com/Rizzo-AI-Academy/rizzo-pii/releases/latest). The steps
> below are for developers who want to regenerate the data and retrain the model.

### 0) Install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Rizzo-AI-Academy/rizzo-pii
cd rizzo-pii
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt          # NVIDIA Blackwell? install torch cu128 first — see requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env                    # optional: add W&B / Gemini keys
```

### 1) Generate the data

```powershell
python src/data_pipeline/llm_template_bank.py --per-type 5 --append          # (opt.) legal templates via Gemini
python src/data_pipeline/generate_synthetic_pii.py -n 200000 --out dataset/synthetic/synthetic_pii_it_200k.jsonl
python src/data_pipeline/augment_real_pii.py     -n 40000  --out dataset/synthetic/synthetic_pii_it_realaug.jsonl
python src/data_pipeline/prepare_deepmount.py                                 # requires HF login
python src/data_pipeline/build_validation.py                                 # real validation (7k, it)
python src/data_pipeline/build_subset.py                                     # 10k/5k subsets for smoke tests
```

### 2) Train

```powershell
# fast smoke test / tuning on the subset (~3 min)  -> experiments/subset_smoke/
python src/training/train_pii.py --type subset

# full run on the whole dataset  -> models/rizzo-pii-0.3B-v{VERSION}/ + experiments/full_run_v{VERSION}/
python src/training/train_pii.py --type full
python src/training/train_pii.py --type full --version 1.2.0   # or an explicit version
```

### 3) Use the model

```powershell
python src/training/test_pii.py "Mi chiamo Mario Rossi, IBAN IT60X0542811101000000123456"
python src/app/app.py            # http://127.0.0.1:5005  (paste text or upload a PDF)
```

The web app assigns every PII a **reversible ID** (`[FULLNAME_1]`, `[IBAN_1]`…) plus a local
dictionary, pairing the model with the regex/checksum net. You copy the anonymized text into an LLM
and **restore** the real values from the response.

## Limitations

Stated plainly:

- **Validation is Italian-only.** Training is multilingual, but the 7,000-row benchmark measures
  Italian only, by design. The other seven languages are trained but not certified.
- **The IT-legal tags are validated against injected entities.** `CF`, `PIVA`, `CATASTO`, `DOCID`,
  `PROVINCE` have no real public data, so even in validation they are generated entities placed into
  real sentences — a good proxy, not a fully blind test.
- **Class imbalance and under-represented categories.** The corpus is heavily skewed (`FULLNAME`
  outnumbers `CREDITCARDNUMBER` ~97×), so the rarer tags are noisier. The clearest case is
  organizations (`ORG`): an open, highly variable class that today comes largely from synthetic
  templates and off-domain Faker data — exactly where a larger, balanced dataset would help most.
- **Off-domain synthetic values.** DeepMount supplies US-style names/addresses: useful for
  form/context, not as Italian values.
- **Evaluation is sentence-level, not document-level.** The benchmark is built from short
  sentences, whereas the real use case is whole documents. Measuring true end-to-end behaviour
  (long context, PDF chunking with overlap, real act structure) needs a dedicated test set of
  large, real Italian documents, which still has to be assembled.

The mitigation that matters in practice: **always pair the model with the regex/checksum safety
net** (`src/inspect/validate_checksums.py` is the blueprint). The two together are stronger than
either alone.

## Next step: a community-owned Italian PII dataset

<img src="report/images/mascot_eu_hat.png" alt="rizzo-pii mascot wearing an EU cap, thumbs up" width="150" align="right" />

rizzo-pii proves the thesis: you **can** keep using frontier models and still keep your data
private, on ordinary hardware, with Italian-legal coverage no other open model offers. The single
biggest lever on quality from here is **data** — a large, real, lawfully collected Italian corpus:
both for the legal identifiers that are scarce today and, above all, to **balance the classes** and
add genuine coverage where the model is weakest (organizations), plus a **test set of large, real
documents** so the model can be measured end-to-end on the documents it is actually meant to
anonymize.

So the project is **open source**, and this is an open invitation. The community dataset lives on
Hugging Face at
**[`rizzoaiacademy/anonimizzazione-testi-italiano`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rizzoaiacademy/anonimizzazione-testi-italiano)**
— a public, collaborative corpus we are starting to fill. If you work with Italian documents —
lawyers, accountants, notaries, developers, researchers — help build it: contribute templates,
annotation, edge cases, and review. **A privacy tool for Italy is something Italy should build
together, for the good of everyone's privacy.**

### Contribute data in one shot — paste this to your coding agent

The script [`src/data_pipeline/contribute_dataset.py`](src/data_pipeline/contribute_dataset.py)
generates **genuinely new** synthetic examples — Gemini writes fresh legal prose on every run,
the code injects valid values (CF/PIVA/IBAN checksums) and exact BIO labels — then opens a
**Pull Request** on the dataset for a maintainer to review. You can let your coding agent
(Claude Code, Cursor, …) do everything: get a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
and a [Hugging Face token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), then **copy-paste the prompt
below** (fill in the two keys and your handle):

```text
Sei nel repository rizzo-pii. Voglio CONTRIBUIRE dati sintetici NUOVI al dataset Hugging Face
"rizzoaiacademy/anonimizzazione-testi-italiano" eseguendo src/data_pipeline/contribute_dataset.py.

I dati DEVONO essere generati davvero da zero: lo script usa Gemini per scrivere NUOVI template
legali ad ogni run (non riusare dati esistenti). Prima di partire LEGGI docs/FORMATO_DATI.md per
capire il formato esatto di ogni esempio (JSONL: source_text, tokens, bio_labels, entities, schema
BIO, checksum CF/PIVA/IBAN obbligatori, nessuna PII reale).

Fai tutto questo, in ordine:
1. Crea/attiva un venv e installa il minimo necessario:  pip install huggingface_hub
   (lo script per i dati NON richiede torch).
2. Imposta le credenziali (NON committarle):
     export GEMINI_API_KEY="<LA_MIA_CHIAVE_GEMINI>"
     export HF_TOKEN="<IL_MIO_TOKEN_HF>"          # in alternativa: hf auth login
3. Fai una prova locale SENZA caricare, controlla la distribuzione dei tag in output:
     python src/data_pipeline/contribute_dataset.py --n 300 --handle <IL_MIO_HANDLE> --no-upload
4. Genera il batch vero e APRI LA PR, rinforzando i tag più deboli (ORG e gli identificativi):
     python src/data_pipeline/contribute_dataset.py --n 5000 --handle <IL_MIO_HANDLE> \
       --per-type 3 --boost ORG=6 IBAN=4 CF=4 CATASTO=3 DOCID=3
5. Stampami l'URL della Pull Request creata.

Vincoli: SOLO dati sintetici (mai PII reali). Se Gemini non è disponibile, fermati e segnalamelo
(non usare --offline senza il mio ok, perché produce dati meno nuovi).
```
